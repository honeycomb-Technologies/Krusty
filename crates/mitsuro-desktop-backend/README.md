# mitsuro-desktop-backend

Protocol types and agent backends for the Mitsuro desktop shell.

## Backends

| Backend | Status | Role |
|---------|--------|------|
| `CodexAppServerBackend` | wired | Spawns local `codex app-server` over stdio |
| `MitsuroServerBackend` | wired for core conversations | Uses canonical `mitsuro-client` over HTTP/SSE |
| `FixtureBackend` | explicit typed subset | Deterministic development and tests |

All implement [`AgentBackend`](src/backend.rs). [`DesktopBackend`](src/desktop.rs)
is the desktop selection/capability boundary and implements the transport-neutral
[`ProductBackend`](src/product.rs) session/model/turn, file/catalog, process, Hive,
and schedule contracts used by GPUI.
`AgentBackend` still contains legacy Codex-shaped methods for backend-specific
surfaces; unsupported methods must return `NotImplemented` and must not be
represented as working product features.

## Mitsuro transport

`MitsuroServerBackend` supports health/connection, session list/create/read/rename/delete,
model list, SSE turn streaming, approvals, cancellation, text-file browsing/reading/fuzzy
search, skills, MCP status, and installed agent-extension discovery. Its base URL defaults
to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and can be changed with `MITSURO_SERVER_URL`. Remote servers use
`MITSURO_SERVER_TOKEN`; the shared client installs it as a bearer header.

The Mitsuro process API can inspect and control processes already tracked by the server,
but it cannot spawn an interactive PTY. The GPUI terminal therefore disables live spawn
for Mitsuro instead of substituting fixture output. Codex stdio uses the current
`command/exec`, `command/exec/write`, `command/exec/resize`, and
`command/exec/terminate` contract for standalone interactive commands. The initial
request intentionally has no generic client timeout because app-server resolves it only
after process exit; the request itself carries explicit server timeout/output policy.
Hive current state remains read-only in GPUI. Global schedules expose typed pause,
resume, and cancellation through the transport-neutral product boundary with revision
and idempotency headers. Creation and replacement preserve the complete typed recurrence,
DST, execution identity, misfire, overlap, and retry contract. Background processes already
tracked by Mitsuro can be terminated, but the server still has no interactive PTY contract
for this client.

## Transport assumptions (Codex app-server)

Verified against the committed `codex-cli 0.147.0` protocol baseline on Linux
(`~/.local/bin/codex app-server --stdio`):

1. **Spawn:** `codex app-server --stdio` (or `CODEX_BIN` env override, default `~/.local/bin/codex` then `codex` on `PATH`).
2. **Framing:** newline-delimited JSON (JSONL). One JSON object per line on stdin/stdout. **Not** LSP `Content-Length` framing.
3. **Request shape:**
   ```json
   {"id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{...}}
   ```
   The JSON-RPC `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` field is optional on this wire; this client includes it for clarity.
4. **Response shape:** `{"id":1,"result":{...}}` or `{"id":1,"error":{"code":...,"message":"..."}}`.
5. **Notifications:** server→client messages with `method` + `params` and **no** `id` (often include `emittedAtMs`).
6. **Server requests:** client must answer approvals (`execCommandApproval`, `applyPatchApproval`, `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`, `item/fileChange/requestApproval`). Incoming requests are classified, mapped to `TurnStreamEvent::ApprovalRequested`, and answered via `CodexAppServerBackend::respond_approval` / `approve` / `deny`.
7. **Handshake:** first client call must be `initialize` with `clientInfo` (`name`, `version`; optional `title`) and optional `capabilities`. The desktop explicitly enables `experimentalApi` because its process, environment, realtime, and background-terminal surfaces use experimental methods.
8. **Offline-safe methods:** `initialize`, `thread/list`, and `thread/start` (use `ephemeral: true` when probing) do not require paid model calls.
9. **Correlation:** request `id` may be `u64` or `string`; this client uses monotonic integer ids.

## Wired methods

- `initialize`
- `thread/list`
- `thread/start`
- `thread/read`
- `thread/resume`
- `thread/unsubscribe`
- `thread/searchOccurrences`
- `thread/turns/list`
- `thread/rollback`
- `turn/start` (live; fixture replay requires explicit fixture mode)
- `account/read` · `account/login/start` · `account/login/cancel` · `account/logout`
- `account/usage/read` · `account/rateLimits/read` (fixture demo offline; no paid models)
- `account/workspaceMessages/read` · `account/rateLimitResetCredit/consume`
- `account/sendAddCreditsNudgeEmail`
- `remoteControl/status/read` · `remoteControl/enable` · `remoteControl/disable`
- `remoteControl/pairing/start` · `remoteControl/pairing/status`
- `remoteControl/client/list` · `remoteControl/client/revoke`
- `externalAgentConfig/detect` · `externalAgentConfig/import`
- `externalAgentConfig/import/readHistories` · `externalAgentConfig/import/recordHistory`
- `experimentalFeature/list` · `experimentalFeature/enablement/set`
- `config/batchWrite`

Remote Control is a Codex-only capability in the current transport matrix. Its typed
status, pairing, client-list, revocation, and lifecycle contracts never fall back to
fixture records; Mitsuro HTTP returns `NotImplemented` through the desktop boundary.

External-agent discovery, import, progress/completion, and history use generated typed
contracts. Detection is read-only; import preserves each detected item's lossless
details payload and remains Codex-only at the desktop capability boundary.

The experimental-feature catalog and process-wide enablement methods are typed. The
desktop persists user-facing beta toggles with typed atomic `config/batchWrite` edits
and asks app-server to reload user config; Mitsuro HTTP returns `NotImplemented`.

The Codex account adapter preserves the complete named rate-limit map, credit and
workspace-spend state, earned reset-credit records, and workspace messages. Reset
consumption and workspace-owner nudges use exact typed mutations. Mitsuro HTTP exposes
none of these ChatGPT account contracts, so its capability flags are false and the
desktop boundary returns `NotImplemented` instead of substituting fixture data.

Conversation find and paged history use the generated Codex wire shapes. The desktop
hydrates an unloaded occurrence by requesting five full turns in both directions from
its `turnCursor`, verifies that the persisted item still exists, and deduplicates the
page against the loaded transcript. Some 0.147.0 app-server builds advertise these
methods in generated schemas but return JSON-RPC `-32601`; for that exact runtime
response, Codex projects the same typed result from a real
`thread/read(includeTurns=true)` payload. Other failures remain failures. Mitsuro
implements the same read-only product behavior from its real persisted session
transcript; it returns `NotImplemented` for `thread/rollback` because the HTTP API has
no destructive tail mutation. Fixture behavior remains explicit and typed for offline
contract tests.

Interactive Codex opens use the generated `thread/resume` contract and return the same
transport-neutral conversation projection as snapshot reads. Leaving an idle thread
uses schema-exact `thread/unsubscribe`; its `notLoaded`, `notSubscribed`, and
`unsubscribed` statuses remain typed. Mitsuro HTTP rejects that Codex-only lifecycle
mutation instead of manufacturing a successful close.

Latest-message editing is a Codex-only product capability. GPUI retains the exact local,
remote, or data-URL image/audio inputs plus skill and mention records from the persisted
user message. Send first calls `thread/rollback` with `numTurns: 1`, replaces the local
transcript from the returned authoritative thread, and starts a real replacement turn
with the edited text and retained inputs. A rollback failure leaves the editor and the
server transcript unchanged. Mitsuro does not render the affordance because it cannot
provide the required atomic tail mutation.

The generated protocol inventories are committed in `fixtures/`: 95 stable client
methods, 133 methods with experimental APIs enabled, 70 server notifications, 10 stable
server requests (11 experimental), and 18 thread item variants for `codex-cli 0.147.0`.
The experimental-only `currentTime/read` request is answered directly from the
client-owned system clock so it cannot stall a turn. Run
`scripts/gpui-codex-protocol-check.sh` after changing the Codex CLI; use `--update` only
when intentionally accepting a reviewed protocol baseline. Inventory and generic Codex
forwarding are not evidence that a fixture or UI feature is implemented.

## Turn streaming

Server notifications are mapped to [`TurnStreamEvent`](src/types.rs):

| Notification | Event |
|--------------|--------|
| `turn/started` | `TurnStarted` |
| `turn/completed` | `TurnCompleted` |
| `item/started` | `ItemStarted` |
| `item/completed` | `ItemCompleted` |
| `item/agentMessage/delta` | `AgentMessageDelta` |
| `item/reasoning/textDelta` | `ReasoningTextDelta` |
| `item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta` | `ReasoningSummaryDelta` |
| `item/plan/delta` | `PlanDelta` |
| `execCommandApproval` / `applyPatchApproval` / `item/*/requestApproval` | `ApprovalRequested` |

Hydrated and live transcripts preserve all 18 current thread item variants. The six
conversation-native variants keep their specialized renderers; tool, search, image,
collaboration, review-mode, compaction, hook, and sleep variants render as restrained
activity rows with their real title, status, and bounded protocol summary. Unknown
future variants remain visible as forward-compatible activity instead of disappearing.

Offline path: [`FixtureBackend`](src/fixture.rs) + `fixtures/sample-turn.jsonl` (embedded as `SAMPLE_TURN_JSONL`). The sample stream injects a mid-turn `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` server request.

Approvals: [`approvals`](src/approvals.rs) — params/response types, `build_approval_result`, `parse_approval_request`.

### Progressive live turns (mid-stream approvals)

Collect-all-then-apply hangs when the server waits on an approval RPC. Use [`live_turn`](src/live_turn.rs):

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| `run_live_turn_progressive` | Deliver each `TurnStreamEvent` as it arrives; `on_approval` → `respond_approval` before further recv |
| `run_live_turn_with_policy` | Non-interactive `AutoApprove` / `AutoReject` (tests) |
| `run_live_turn_with_bridge` / `_blocking` | UI: block on `LiveApprovalBridge` until Approve/Reject |
| `LiveApprovalBridge` | `wait` / `submit` handoff between turn loop and ApprovalBar |

Real network turns remain gated by `MITSURO_ALLOW_LIVE_TURN=1` in the desktop shell.

## Tests

MITSURO_RUN_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE=1 scripts/gpui-dual-backend-acceptance.sh

# Optional: select another configured Mitsuro model when validating the HTTP/SSE
# transport independently of a known outage in the server-selected provider:
MITSURO_RUN_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE=1 \
MITSURO_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_MODEL="your-configured-model-id" \
  scripts/gpui-dual-backend-acceptance.sh
```
