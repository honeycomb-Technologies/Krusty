## What is Mitsuro?

Mitsuro brings conversations, code sessions, and autonomous work into one
connected workspace.

- **Agent** is the interactive experience for coding, questions, and project
  work.
- **Hive** runs durable tasks that can continue in the background and recover
  across restarts.
- **Your server** owns sessions, tools, and project access. Mobile, web,
  desktop, terminal, and editor clients connect to the same source of truth.

Mitsuro works with multiple AI providers and keeps provider credentials under
your control. Tool permissions remain explicit, and project data is stored by
the Mitsuro server rather than split across client-only copies.

## Ways to use it

| Surface | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| **iPhone** | Conversations, code sessions, Hive runs, reports, and remote tools |
| **Web** | The full Mitsuro workspace in a browser |
| **Desktop** | A native desktop window around the shared web workspace |
| **Terminal** | Interactive coding via the modern Mitsuro TUI (`mitsuro` / `krusty` alias) |
| **Editor** | Connecting compatible editors through ACP |

## Highlights

- Stream conversations and tool activity as work happens.
- Resume saved sessions and recover interrupted work.
- Switch between supported providers and models without changing clients.
- Review approvals, errors, reports, and background runs from the same
  workspace.
- Extend the agent with skills, plugins, MCP servers, and local extensions.
- Keep the server self-hosted and connect privately from your other devices.



## Terminal

The default CLI experience is the modern Mitsuro terminal UI:

```bash
mitsuro
# compatibility alias still works
krusty
```

The previous full-screen TUI is archived on git branch `archive/tui-v1-20260802`
and is no longer the product default.

## Install

Download the installer, inspect it if desired, and run it:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honeycomb-Technologies/Mitsuro/main/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

The installer verifies the published SHA-256 checksum before installing a
release.

Start the terminal app:

```bash
mitsuro
```

Start the server and web workspace:

```bash
mitsuro serve
```

`mitsuro` is the primary command. The deprecated `krusty` command remains a
tested compatibility alias during the announced migration window.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/honeycomb-Technologies/Mitsuro.git
cd Mitsuro
cargo build --release
```

See [Building and deployment](docs/operations/build-and-deploy.md) for platform
requirements and client build instructions.

## Repository guide

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`crates/`](crates/) | Shared Rust engine, command-line app, and server |
| [`apps/mobile/`](apps/mobile/) | Expo app used by the iPhone and web clients |
| [`apps/desktop/shell/`](apps/desktop/shell/) | Desktop host for the web client |
| [`packages/`](packages/) | Shared TypeScript API, state, and UI packages |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | Stable architecture and contributor documentation |

## Development

The repository uses Rust for the core runtime and Expo/React Native for the
shared client.

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
```

For the mobile and web client:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
bun install --frozen-lockfile
npx tsc --noEmit
npx expo export --platform web
```
